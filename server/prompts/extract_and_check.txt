Decompose the text into distinct points, regardless of their validity. Consider all details to be different points. Each point should only contain 1 or 2 facts.
For example, if the text is 'The Pythagorean Theorem is x^2+y^2=z^3. This can be proven by
geometry or dot product.', the points will be 'The Pythagorean Theorem is x^2+y^2=z^3' and 
'The Pythagorean Theorem can be proven by geometry or dot product.' Even though the stated Pythagorean Theorem is incorrect,
still consider it as a point.

Then, search for sources to rigorously evaluate the validity of each point.
If the point is a proposal or a new research finding, make an educated guess of evaluate it as unknown

The following is the text:
